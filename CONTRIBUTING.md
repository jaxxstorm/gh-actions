# Contributing to gh-actions

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just
guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel free to propose
changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, [open an issue] to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as
  changes are developed.

## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the [Conventional Commits] specification to standardize our commit
history.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending
the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an
imperative, present tense sentence (without a period).

Example: `fix: make header bold`

If you are still working on your pull request, prepend `WIP:` to indicate that
it's work in progress.

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix,
chore, feat, etc.) Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`

## Documentation

Improving our documentation is key for the longevity and interest towards in
this library. We love help to expand and improve the documentation!
